# Residential-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-project
In this project my goal is to determine housing market prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. Through predictive modeling, data analysis, and model evaluation, we aim to provide valuable insights for informed investment decisions in the dynamic real estate market.
