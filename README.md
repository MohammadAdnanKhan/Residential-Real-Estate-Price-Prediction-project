# Residential-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-project

Welcome to the Residential Real Estate Price Prediction project!
In this project my goal is to determine housing market prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. Through predictive modeling, data analysis, and model evaluation, we aim to provide valuable insights for informed investment decisions in the dynamic real estate market.


# Key Features
<H6>Predictive Modeling: Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, we aim to build models that accurately predict housing prices based on given features.</H6>
Data Analysis: Through exploratory data analysis, we delve into the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers that could influence housing prices.
Model Evaluation: We rigorously evaluate the performance of our models using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy in our predictions.
Insight Generation: Beyond prediction, we seek to extract actionable insights from our analysis, providing valuable information to stakeholders in the real estate investment domain.
