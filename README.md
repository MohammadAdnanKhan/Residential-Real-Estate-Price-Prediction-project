# 🏡 Residential Real Estate Price Prediction Project 📈
Welcome to the Residential Real Estate Price Prediction project! 🎉
In this Project, I am working as a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust. My task is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. Through predictive modeling, data analysis, and model evaluation, I aim to provide valuable insights for informed investment decisions in the dynamic real estate market.

# Objective 🎯
The primary objective of this project is to:

* Predict housing prices accurately based on various features.
* Analyze the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers that influence housing prices.
* Evaluate model performance rigorously to ensure reliability and accuracy in predictions.
* Generate actionable insights beyond prediction to provide valuable information to stakeholders in the real estate investment domain.

# Key Features 🔑
* Predictive Modeling:
I aim to build models that accurately predict housing prices based on given features.

* Data Analysis:
Through exploratory data analysis, I delve into the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers that could influence housing prices.

* Model Evaluation:
I rigorously evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy in the predictions.

* Insight Generation:
Beyond prediction, I seek to extract actionable insights from the analysis, providing valuable information to stakeholders in the real estate investment domain.

# Dataset 📊
The dataset contains information on residential real estate properties including attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and the corresponding market prices.
