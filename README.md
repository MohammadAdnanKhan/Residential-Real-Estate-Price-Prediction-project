# Residential Real Estate Price Prediction Project

<H3>Welcome to the Residential Real Estate Price Prediction project!</H3>
In this Project, I am working as a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. I am tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. Through predictive modelling, data analysis, and model evaluation, I aim to provide valuable insights for informed investment decisions in the dynamic real estate market.

# Key Features
<H4>Predictive Modeling:</H4> Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, I aim to build models that accurately predict housing prices based on given features.
<H4>Data Analysis:</H4> Through exploratory data analysis, I delve into the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers that could influence housing prices.
<H4>Model Evaluation:</H4> I rigorously evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy in the predictions.
<H4>Insight Generation:</H4> Beyond prediction, I seek to extract actionable insights from the analysis, providing valuable information to stakeholders in the real estate investment domain.

# Contributions
I welcome contributions from the community to enhance this project further. Whether it's optimizing existing models, exploring additional features, or improving documentation, your contributions are valuable in advancing our understanding of residential real estate markets.
